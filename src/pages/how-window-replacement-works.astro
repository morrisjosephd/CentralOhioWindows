      <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">What to Expect During Window Replacement</h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-base-content/80 mb-12">
        If you've never had your windows replaced, the process can feel uncertain. The good
        news is that window replacement is one of the most straightforward home improvement
        projects — and one of the most rewarding. Here's a step-by-step look at what happens
        from start to finish.
      </p>

      <!-- Step 1 -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Step 1: Initial Consultation and Measurement</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          The process begins when a contractor visits your home. They'll measure each window
          opening, inspect the surrounding frames for signs of rot or structural concerns,
          and discuss your goals — whether that's improving energy efficiency, updating the
          look of your home, or addressing drafty, hard-to-operate windows. This visit
          typically takes 30–60 minutes and is usually free.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Step 2 -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Step 2: Choosing Your Windows</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          Next, you'll select the style, frame material, glass type, and features for your
          new windows. Your contractor will recommend options based on your home's architecture,
          your budget, and the performance characteristics that matter most to you. This is the
          time to ask questions about energy ratings, warranties, and available upgrades like
          Low-E coatings or triple-pane glass.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Step 3 -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Step 3: Getting Your Quote</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          A reputable contractor will provide a detailed, written quote that breaks down all
          costs. This should include materials, labor, permits (if required by your
          municipality), and cleanup. Be wary of vague or verbal-only estimates — a good
          quote puts everything in writing so there are no surprises.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Step 4 -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Step 4: Scheduling Installation</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          Once you approve the quote, your contractor will schedule the installation. Most
          standard window projects can be scheduled within 2–6 weeks. Custom windows —
          including unusual sizes, shapes, or specialty finishes — may take longer to
          manufacture and could extend the timeline.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Step 5 -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Step 5: Installation Day</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          On installation day, the crew will work through each window one at a time. Here's
          what typically happens:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base-content/80">
          <li>The old window is carefully removed</li>
          <li>The opening is prepped and inspected for any hidden damage</li>
          <li>The new window is set in place, leveled, and secured</li>
          <li>Insulation is added around the frame to eliminate drafts</li>
          <li>The window is sealed and trimmed for a clean, finished look</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mt-4">
          Most full-home window replacements (10–15 windows) take just 1–2 days. Smaller
          projects of 3–5 windows can often be completed in a single day.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Step 6 -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Step 6: Final Inspection and Cleanup</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          After installation, the contractor will verify that every window operates properly —
          opening, closing, and locking smoothly. They'll check all seals for a tight fit and
          clean up any debris from the work. You should do a walk-through together to confirm
          you're satisfied with every window before signing off on the project.
        </p>

      <!-- Step 7 -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Step 7: Warranty and Follow-Up</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          Most quality replacement windows come with warranties of 20 years or more — some
          offer lifetime coverage. Make sure you receive all warranty documentation and keep
          it in a safe place. If you notice any issues after installation, such as drafts,
          condensation between panes, or difficulty operating a window, report them to your
          contractor promptly so they can be addressed under warranty.

      <!-- Tips to Prepare -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Tips to Prepare for Installation Day</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-base-content/80">
          <li>
            <strong>Clear furniture from window areas</strong> — Give the crew at least 3–4
            feet of clearance around each window being replaced.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remove window treatments</strong> — Take down curtains, blinds, and any
            decorations near the windows ahead of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure pets</strong> — Keep pets in a separate room or area away from
            the work zones. Doors will be opening and closing throughout the day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan for noise</strong> — Window installation involves some noise from
            removal and power tools. It's a normal part of the process and typically
            wraps up quickly.
