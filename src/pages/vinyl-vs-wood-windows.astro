      <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">Vinyl vs. Wood Windows: Which Is Right for Your Central Ohio Home?</h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-base-content/80 mb-12">
        Vinyl and wood are the two most popular frame materials for replacement windows —
        and each brings real strengths to the table. Choosing between them comes down to your
        budget, maintenance tolerance, and the look you want for your home. Here's an honest
        comparison to help you decide.
      </p>

      <!-- Vinyl Windows -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Vinyl Windows</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Vinyl frames are made from PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and are the most popular choice
          for replacement windows across Central Ohio. They're affordable, low-maintenance, and
          hold up well against Ohio's unpredictable weather.

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <li>Most affordable frame material on the market</li>

          <li>Wide variety of styles and colors available</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Cons</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base-content/80">
          <li>Cannot be painted or refinished — color is permanent</li>

          <li>Can expand and contract slightly in extreme temperatures</li>
          <li>Lower resale perceived value compared to wood</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Wood Windows</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Wood frames offer a classic, premium appearance that many homeowners love. They're
          a natural insulator and can be customized with paint or stain to match any style.
          However, they require more upkeep to stay in top shape.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Pros</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base-content/80 mb-4">

          <li>High perceived value and curb appeal</li>
          <li>Longest lifespan when properly maintained (30–50+ years)</li>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Cons</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base-content/80">
          <li>Significantly more expensive than vinyl</li>
          <li>Requires regular painting, staining, or sealing to prevent rot</li>
          <li>Susceptible to moisture damage, insects, and decay without maintenance</li>

      <!-- Which Is Better for Central Ohio? -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Which Is Better for Central Ohio?</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Central Ohio experiences significant temperature swings — from below -10&deg;F in
          winter to 95&deg;F+ in summer — along with high humidity, rain, and occasional ice
          storms. That puts real demands on your window frames.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <strong>Vinyl</strong> handles Ohio's moisture and temperature extremes exceptionally
          well with zero maintenance. It won't rot, warp, or need repainting after a harsh
          winter. For most homeowners, vinyl is the practical, budget-friendly choice.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          <strong>Wood</strong> offers superior aesthetics and is a great fit for historic homes
          or homeowners who want a premium look. However, Central Ohio's humidity means you'll
          need to stay on top of painting and sealing to prevent moisture damage. If you're
          willing to invest the time and money in upkeep, wood windows can last a lifetime.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- What About Fiberglass? -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What About Fiberglass?</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Fiberglass is a third option worth considering. It combines many of the best
          qualities of both vinyl and wood — it's low-maintenance like vinyl, strong and
          durable like wood, and offers excellent energy efficiency.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          Fiberglass windows typically cost <strong>$500–$1,200 per window</strong>, putting
          them between vinyl and high-end wood options. They resist expansion and contraction
          better than vinyl and won't rot like wood. If your budget allows, fiberglass is a
          premium alternative that performs exceptionally well in Ohio's climate.
