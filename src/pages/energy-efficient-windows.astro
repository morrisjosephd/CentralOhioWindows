      <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">Energy-Efficient Windows for Central Ohio Homes</h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-base-content/80 mb-12">
        Central Ohio's climate demands a lot from your windows. With hot, humid summers
        and cold, harsh winters, your heating and cooling systems run for much of the year.
        Energy-efficient windows help keep conditioned air inside your home, reduce the
        strain on your HVAC system, and lower your monthly utility bills. Here's what you
        need to know before you buy.

      <!-- What Makes a Window Energy Efficient -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What Makes a Window Energy Efficient?</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Several technologies work together to make modern windows far more efficient
          than those manufactured even a decade ago:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-base-content/80">
          <li>
            <strong>Low-E glass coatings</strong> — A microscopically thin metallic coating
            on the glass that reflects heat while still letting natural light pass through.
            In winter, Low-E keeps heat inside; in summer, it reflects solar heat away.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Argon or krypton gas fills</strong> — The space between panes is filled
            with an inert gas that insulates significantly better than regular air, reducing
            heat transfer through the glass.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiple panes</strong> — Double-pane windows are the standard for energy
            efficiency, while triple-pane windows offer even greater insulation for homes in
            colder climates like Central Ohio.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality frame materials</strong> — Vinyl and fiberglass frames offer much
            better insulation than aluminum. They don't conduct heat or cold the way metal
            does, and they resist warping and rotting over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Warm edge spacers</strong> — The spacer bars that separate the glass panes
            are made from low-conductivity materials to reduce heat transfer at the edges of
            the glass, preventing condensation and cold spots.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Understanding Energy Ratings -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Understanding Window Energy Ratings</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-6">
          When shopping for windows, you'll encounter several performance ratings. Here's
          what they mean and what to look for in Central Ohio:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="card bg-base-200">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3 class="card-title text-xl">U-Factor</h3>
              <p class="text-base-content/80">
                Measures how well a window prevents heat from escaping. The lower the
                U-Factor, the better the window insulates. For Central Ohio's climate,
                look for a U-Factor of <strong>0.30 or lower</strong> to keep your home
                warm in winter without excessive energy use.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="card bg-base-200">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3 class="card-title text-xl">Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)</h3>
              <p class="text-base-content/80">
                Measures how much solar radiation passes through the window as heat. A
                lower SHGC means less solar heat is admitted. For Ohio, an SHGC between
                <strong>0.25 and 0.40</strong> is ideal — low enough to reduce summer
                cooling costs, but not so low that you lose beneficial solar warmth in winter.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="card bg-base-200">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3 class="card-title text-xl">Energy Star Certification</h3>
              <p class="text-base-content/80">
                Energy Star certified windows meet strict energy efficiency guidelines set
                by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Windows are rated by climate
                zone — Central Ohio falls in the Northern zone. Energy Star certification
                gives you confidence that a window will perform well and can also qualify
                you for federal tax credits.

      <!-- How Much Can You Save -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">How Much Can You Save?</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Replacing old, inefficient windows with Energy Star certified models can make a
          meaningful difference in your monthly energy costs:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-base-content/80">
          <li>
            <strong>Energy Star estimates $101–$583 in annual savings</strong> when replacing
            single-pane windows, depending on the number of windows and your home's size.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Central Ohio homeowners typically see a 15–25% reduction</strong> in
            heating and cooling costs after upgrading to energy-efficient windows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Most energy-efficient windows pay for themselves in 5–10 years</strong>
            through energy savings alone — and they continue saving you money every year
            after that.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mt-4">
          Beyond the financial savings, energy-efficient windows also improve your home's
          comfort by eliminating drafts, reducing hot spots near sun-facing windows, and
          keeping indoor temperatures more consistent throughout the day.

      <!-- Tax Credits -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Federal Tax Credits for Energy-Efficient Windows</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          The federal government offers financial incentives to homeowners who upgrade to
          energy-efficient windows through the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-base-content/80">
          <li>
            <strong>Up to $600 per year</strong> in tax credits for qualifying windows and
            skylights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Windows must meet Energy Star Most Efficient criteria</strong> to qualify
            for the credit. Your contractor or window manufacturer can confirm whether
            specific products qualify.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The credit applies to product cost only</strong> — installation labor
            is not included. Keep your receipts and manufacturer certification statements
            for your tax filing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mt-4">
          This credit is available annually, so if you're replacing windows in phases over
          multiple years, you can claim the credit each year you make qualifying purchases.
          Consult a tax professional for details specific to your situation.
