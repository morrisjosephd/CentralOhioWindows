      <!-- Cost Factors -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What Affects the Cost of Replacement Windows?</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          No two window replacement projects are exactly alike. Here are the main factors
          that influence what you'll pay:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-base-content/80">
          <li>
            <strong>Window size and style</strong> — Larger windows and specialty shapes
            (arched, geometric) cost more than standard sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frame material</strong> — Vinyl is the most affordable at $200–$500 per
            window, wood ranges from $400–$900, and fiberglass runs $500–$1,200.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Glass type</strong> — Upgrading from standard double-pane to triple-pane
            or adding Low-E coatings improves energy efficiency but increases the price.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Number of windows being replaced</strong> — Contractors often offer
            per-window discounts on larger projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Labor and installation complexity</strong> — Second-story windows,
            structural modifications, or custom sizing add to labor costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Permit requirements in your area</strong> — Some Central Ohio
            municipalities require permits for window replacement, adding a small fee
            to the project.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Average Project Cost -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Average Whole-House Window Replacement Cost</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Most Central Ohio homeowners pay <strong>$8,000–$15,000</strong> for a whole-house
          window replacement project (10–15 windows). Smaller projects (3–5 windows) typically
          run <strong>$2,000–$5,000</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          These estimates include materials, labor, and standard installation. Your actual
          cost will depend on the factors above, which is why getting a personalized quote
          is the best way to know your exact price.
