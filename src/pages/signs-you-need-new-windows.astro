      <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-6">7 Signs It's Time to Replace Your Windows</h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-base-content/80 mb-12">
        Not sure if your windows need replacing? Here are seven telltale signs that
        it's time to invest in new windows for your Central Ohio home.
      </p>

      <!-- Sign 1: Drafty Rooms -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Drafty Rooms Even with Windows Closed</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          If you feel cold air seeping around your window frames even when they're
          fully shut, your weatherstripping has likely worn out or the window seals
          have failed. Drafts are one of the most common and noticeable signs that
          your windows are no longer doing their job.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Drafty windows force your heating system
          to work harder, driving up your energy bills throughout Central Ohio's cold
          winters. The discomfort of cold spots near windows also reduces the livable
          space in your home.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          <strong>What to do:</strong> New windows with proper sealing and modern
          weatherstripping eliminate drafts completely, keeping your home comfortable
          year-round and lowering your heating costs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Sign 2: Condensation Between Panes -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2. Condensation Between Glass Panes</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Moisture or fogging between the panes of your double- or triple-pane
          windows is a clear sign that the window seal has failed. That hazy,
          cloudy appearance isn't something you can clean away — it's trapped
          inside the glass unit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The insulating gas (usually argon)
          between panes has escaped, which means the window is no longer energy
          efficient. You're essentially left with the insulating value of a
          single-pane window.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          <strong>What to do:</strong> Once the seal fails, the glass unit needs
          to be replaced. In most cases, replacing the entire window is more
          cost-effective and ensures a proper seal and full energy efficiency.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Sign 3: Difficulty Operating -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">3. Difficulty Opening, Closing, or Locking</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Windows that stick, won't stay open, are hard to slide, or won't lock
          properly are more than just an annoyance. These problems often indicate
          frame warping, balance failure, or worn-out hardware.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Windows that don't lock are a security
          risk for your home. Windows that won't open properly can be a safety hazard
          in an emergency when you may need to use them as an exit. Warped frames
          also let air and moisture infiltrate your home.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          <strong>What to do:</strong> While minor hardware issues can sometimes be
          repaired, frame warping and persistent operating problems usually mean
          it's time for replacement. New windows operate smoothly and lock securely.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Sign 4: High Energy Bills -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">4. High Energy Bills</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          If your heating and cooling costs keep climbing despite no major changes in
          your habits, your windows could be the culprit. Old single-pane windows or
          failing double-pane windows are major energy wasters, letting conditioned
          air escape and outdoor temperatures creep in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Central Ohio's hot summers and cold winters
          mean your HVAC system runs heavily for much of the year. Inefficient windows
          can account for 25–30% of your home's heating and cooling energy loss.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          <strong>What to do:</strong> Upgrading to energy-efficient windows with
          Low-E coatings and gas fills can significantly reduce your utility bills.
          Many homeowners see a 15–25% reduction in heating and cooling costs after
          replacement.
        </p>

      <!-- Sign 5: Excessive Outside Noise -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">5. Excessive Outside Noise</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          If you can clearly hear traffic, neighbors, lawn equipment, or other outside
          noise through your closed windows, they aren't providing adequate sound
          insulation. This is especially noticeable if you live near a busy road or
          in a densely built neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Excessive noise intrusion reduces your
          comfort and quality of life at home. Poor sound insulation also correlates
          directly with poor thermal insulation — if noise gets through easily,
          so does heat and cold.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          <strong>What to do:</strong> Modern double- and triple-pane windows with
          insulating gas fills dramatically reduce outside noise. Laminated glass
          options provide even greater sound reduction for homes in particularly
          noisy areas.
        </p>

      <!-- Sign 6: Visible Damage -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">6. Visible Damage</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Rotting wood frames, warped vinyl, cracked glass, or peeling paint around
          your windows are all signs of deterioration that should not be ignored.
          These issues tend to worsen over time, especially with Central Ohio's
          freeze-thaw cycles.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Damaged window frames allow water to seep
          into your walls, leading to mold growth, structural damage, and costly
          repairs. Cracked glass compromises both insulation and security.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          <strong>What to do:</strong> Don't wait for water damage to spread. Replacing
          damaged windows promptly protects your home's structure and prevents more
          expensive repairs down the road.
        </p>

      <!-- Sign 7: Windows Are 20+ Years Old -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">7. Your Windows Are 20+ Years Old</h2>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          Even well-maintained windows have a finite lifespan. If your windows were
          installed more than 20 years ago, they've likely passed their prime
          regardless of how they look on the surface.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-4">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Window technology has advanced significantly
          over the past two decades. Modern windows are far more energy efficient,
          durable, and secure than those made 20 years ago. Seals, weatherstripping,
          and hardware all degrade over time even with proper care.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base-content/80">
          <strong>What to do:</strong> If your windows are approaching or past the
          20-year mark, it's worth getting a professional assessment. You may be
          surprised at the comfort and energy savings that new windows deliver.
